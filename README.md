A great simple game.

This game was done with unity5, used simple graphics and c# for the scripts.
Animations were done in blender.

The controls are WASD, and spacebar to slow down when moving.
This repo includes everything you need to create your own levels.

I will add a list of items that can be added, and if there's enough time and built-in level editor.
