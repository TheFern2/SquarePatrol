A great game tutorial I followed on youtube

This game was done with unity5.

The controls are WASD, and spacebar to slow down when moving.
I follow a tutorial on youtube "Making a Simple Game on Unity" from Awful Media. Note: Tutorial Not made by me.

I did a lot of changes of my own, so I was very pleased with the end result.
